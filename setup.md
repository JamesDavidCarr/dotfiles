Hey! It seems that you want to install these dotfiles.

I've included a setup.sh file to help install these dotfiles
onto your computer.

A couple of things to note.

1. vim will be a bit annoying to install. You'll have to deal with
it expecting the packages to be installed and a couple of warning
screens.

2. Sublime will install all of the correct packages but it'll take
a little while and things will look like they're broken.

3. Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts and turn off ctrl+<up arrow> so that you can select consecutive lines on sublime. Just use three finger swipe to reach mission control instead.
